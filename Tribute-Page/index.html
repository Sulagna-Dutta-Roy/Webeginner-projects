              angel investor, CEO, and Product Architect of Tesla, Inc.; founder
              of The Boring Company; and co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI.

        Tesla, Inc.—originally Tesla Motors—was incorporated in 2003 by Martin
        Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, who financed the company until the Series
        A round of funding. Both men played active roles in the company's
        early development prior to Musk's involvement.Musk led the Series
        A round of investment in February 2004; he invested $6.5 million, became
        the majority shareholder, and joined Tesla's board of directors as
        chairman.

      <p class="fs-4 p-3 m-4 fw-normal text-center">
        In early 2001, Musk became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society and
        discussed funding plans to place a growth-chamber for plants on
        Mars.SpaceX attempted its first launch of the Falcon 1 rocket in
        2006. Though the rocket failed to reach Earth orbit, it was awarded
        a Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program contract from NASA
        Administrator (and former SpaceX consultant) Mike Griffin later that
        year.

      <p class="fs-4 p-3 m-4 fw-normal text-center">
        In 2017, Musk founded The Boring Company to construct tunnels. Musk
        revealed plans for specialized high occupancy vehicles that could travel
        up to 150 miles per hour, circumventing above-ground traffic in major
        cities. Early in 2017, the company began discussions with
        regulatory bodies and initiated construction of a 30-foot (9.1 m) wide,
        50-foot (15 m) long, and 15-foot (4.6 m) deep "test trench" on the
        premises of SpaceX's offices as it required no permits

              In 2002, Musk founded SpaceX, an aerospace manufacturer and space
              transport services company, of which he serves as CEO and Chief
              Engineer. In 2004, he was an early investor in electric vehicle
              manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.). He became its
              chairman and product architect, eventually assuming the position
              of CEO in 2008. In 2006, he helped create SolarCity, a solar
              energy company that was later acquired by Tesla and became Tesla
              Energy. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit research
              company promoting friendly artificial intelligence (AI). In 2016,
              he co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company focused on
              developing brain–computer interfaces, and founded The Boring
              Company, a tunnel construction company. He agreed to purchase the
              major American social networking service Twitter in 2022, for $44
              billion, but later stated he was terminating the deal; he is
              currently involved in a legal battle with Twitter which intends to
              complete the transaction. Musk has proposed a hyperloop high-speed
              vactrain transportation system and is the president of the Musk
              Foundation, which donates to scientific research and education.
              Musk has been criticized for making unscientific and controversial
              statements, such as spreading misinformation about the COVID-19
              pandemic. In 2018, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
              (SEC) sued Musk for falsely tweeting that he had secured funding
              for a private takeover of Tesla; he settled with the SEC but did
              not admit guilt, and he temporarily stepped down from his Tesla
              chairmanship. In 2019, he won a defamation case brought against
              him by a British caver who had advised in the Tham Luang cave
              rescue.

              Musk has promoted cryptocurrencies and supports them over
              traditional government-issued fiat currencies.[394] Given the
              influence of Musk's tweets on moving cryptocurrency markets,
              his statements around cryptocurrencies have been viewed as market
              manipulation by some, such as economist Nouriel Roubini.[396]
              Musk's social media praising of Bitcoin and Dogecoin was credited
              for increasing their prices. Consequently, Tesla's 2021
              announcement that it bought $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin raised
              questions against the backdrop of Musk's social media
              behavior. Tesla's announcement that it would accept Bitcoin
              for payment was criticized by environmentalists and investors due
              to the environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining; in 2021, the
              energy consumption of Bitcoin mining, which has built-in energy
              inefficiency, exceeded that of Argentina. A few months later, in
              response to the criticism, Musk announced on Twitter that Tesla
              would no longer accept Bitcoin and would not engage in any Bitcoin
              transactions until the environmental issues are solved
            </p>

            <p class="fs-4">
              Musk has stated that he does not believe the US government should
              provide subsidies to companies; instead they should use a carbon
              tax to discourage poor behavior. Musk says that the free
              market would achieve the best solution, and that producing
              environmentally unfriendly vehicles should come with its own
              consequences.[382] His stance has been called hypocritical as
              Tesla has received billions of dollars in subsidies.

            <p class="lead fw-semibold fs-2 my-4 text-muted">Politics</p>
            <p class="fs-4">
              Although often described as libertarian, Musk has called himself
              "politically moderate" and was a registered independent when he
              lived in California. The New York Times noted that Musk "expresses
              views that don't fit neatly into [the American] binary, left-right
              political framework." Historically, Musk has donated to both
              Democrats and Republicans, many of whom are in states in
              which he has a vested interest. Musk has praised China and
              has been described as having a "charm offensive" to woo the
              Chinese government and access its markets for Tesla.[
