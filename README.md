###  How to Start?

###  Submit a Pull Request :

Branch naming convention is as following

`TYPE-ISSUE_ID-DESCRIPTION`

When `TYPE` can be:

- **feat** - is a new project
- **doc** - documentation only changes
- **fix** - a bug fix/improving of any project

**All PRs must include a commit message with the changes description!**

<b> <h3> For the initial start, fork the project and use git clone command to download the repository to your computer </b> </h3>. A standard procedure for working on an issue would be to:

1. `git pull`, before creating a new branch, pull the changes from upstream. Your master needs to be up to date.

```
$ git pull
```

2. Create new branch from `master`
```
$ git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]
```

3. Work - commit - repeat ( be sure to be in your branch )


4. Push changes to GitHub

```
$ git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch]
```

5. Submit your changes for review
   If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button.
   
6. Start a Pull Request
   Now submit the pull request and click on `Create pull request`.
   
7. Get a code review approval/reject

8. After approval, merge your PR 

9. GitHub will automatically delete the branch after the merge is done. (they can still be restored).

10. You made it! ðŸŽŠ
